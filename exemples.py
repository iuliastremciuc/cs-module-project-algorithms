When coloring a striped pattern, you may start by coloring each square sequentially, 
meaning you spend time needing to switch coloring pencils.

Create a function where given a list of colors cols, 
return how long it takes to color the whole pattern. Note the following times:

It takes 1 second to switch between pencils.
It takes 2 seconds to color a square.
